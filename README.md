# gymticks

Adapted from the [seed-rs todomvc example](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed/tree/master/examples/todomvc)

This is a very specialized Todo app for keeping track of routes completed in a climbing gym

## TODO

- [ ] flag a route (as a project)?
- [ ] star a route?
- [ ] better style for grade/section selector
- [ ] better style for color selector
- [ ] display more exciting aggregate information about ticks
- [ ] some sort of animation when modifying, sending, or adding a route
- [ ] undo button
- [ ] separate persistent and non-persistent app state
- [ ] move import/export somewhere else?
- [ ] footer shouldn't be covered by navbar when there are no routes
