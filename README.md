# gymticks

This is a very specialized Todo app for keeping track of routes completed ("sent"/"ascended") and/or attempted in a climbing gym.

Originally adapted from the [seed-rs 0.6 todomvc example](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed/tree/0.6.0/examples/todomvc).

## Demo

There may be a demo running [here](https://gymticks.robparrett.com).

## TODO

- [ ] flag a route (as a project)? or just make unsent routes more obvious?
- [ ] star a route?
- [ ] better style for grade/section selector
- [ ] better style for color selector
- [ ] better style for main display with (sticky?) section headers
- [ ] display more exciting aggregate information about ticks
- [ ] some sort of animation when modifying, sending, or adding a route
- [ ] undo button, or at least unretire and a way of deleting ticks
- [ ] move import/export somewhere else?
- [ ] give exported file a better filename
- [ ] reimplement import/export in rust
- [ ] button for retiring an entire section at once
